You got one sentence to make an strong impression and another sentence to make me continue reading.
I "knew" the theory but struggled to "understand" it. I kept making things, make them fail - then make things again. If you fail enough, you start to get a grasp at what works and what does not. Then you create a process.

**closeheat is about giving you a bulletproof process to create campaigns.** Whether its a landing page for business idea validation, building an existing product landing page with your team or creating a squeeze page for your latest book.

The search for that process in platforms that let you "Build, Publish & A/B Test Landing Pages Without I.T." failed. I loved how quickly you can build you initial draft. But you are forced to use their WYSIWYG editor and their designs.

With closeheat, we provide that quick iteration cycle and high-converting designs, but also give you huge flexibility. You can edit your landing page code in browser. You can import your custom HTML design. You can even use "Sublime Text" or any other text editor you like since you can update your website through Github.

Me and my team will be sharing our experiences in creating our little hacks and campaigns every week.

The hack nobody knows about - "Growth Hacking in Slack communities" next week! You can subscribe below.

Or do a Google Hangout with me and lets talk about newest tricks growth hacking or business development. Email me at domas@closeheat.com and we'll schedule it.
