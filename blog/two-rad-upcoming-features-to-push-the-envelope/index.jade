    It's been two months since we released the HTML editing capabilities in
    browser. I believe that we're onto something huge.

    Me and my comrade [@jpalumickas](http://twitter.com/jpalumickas) had to push what's available in your
    browser to the limit just to make
    what we have right now. Things that are coming are going to push it
    way further - I believe its beyond where anybody has been.

    For the last few months we've listened to all of you guys. We're still
    small, only got a few awesome guys hosting their awesome projects with us
    (thanks [Tony](https://twitter.com/Cephalization/status/626173187898888194)!).

    Nonetheless, all of the few hundred amazing people already shaped our
    company - we hear you.

    ### "Yes" to Human Friendliness

    *Everybody - designers, coders, marketers, regular human beings can work
    together. They really can - they are only lacking the tools to connect.*

    I believe there will be a platform for them to connect eventually. Sadly,
    closeheat fills only the coder side. Somebody who has coding
    chops can really host his websites [here](http://app.closeheat.com/users/sign_up)
    without any headaches.

    To make it accessible for other mortals, we're working on two rad things.

    ## I. Click and Drag Editor
    ![Click and Drag Editor show-off](/blog/two-rad-upcoming-features-to-push-the-envelope/click-drag-editor.gif)

    *You just click on things and change them.*

    The magic is that it all translates back to the source code.
    Edit a bit of your website with click & drag, go back to the code - edit
    a bit there. Its all seamless.

    We drew on [Nick Santos from Medium](https://medium.com/medium-eng/why-contenteditable-is-terrible-122d8a40e480)
    axioms for a great web editor. The start is in small calculated steps.
    Over the next month we're unveiling the first version of the click & drag
    mode.

    - [Nick Santos](https://twitter.com/nicksantos)

    The fancy part is that all the edits that goes back to the code editor and
    back to Jade or HTML. Both the regular humans and coders are happy. *World peace
    is restored.*

    ## II. Edit CSS, Javascript, Everything in Browser

    A lot of you guys wondered - "How to change the style of my webpage in closeheat?".
    We had an unsatisfying answer - there's no way. We scraped the existing
    web editor in a "betaish" fashion - to check if anybody feels as much
    love for it as we do.

    Designers hate terminal, git and editors in general. They are limiting, slow and
    with a steep learning curve. To be honest, we hate it too and we are finding a way.

    At the moment of writing, [@jpalumickas](http://twitter.com/jpalumickas) is
    chopping his way into this territory. It's cool that we can edit this index.jade
    at the moment, but he'll let us drill into CSS and even Javascript in our
    browsers. It will make it possible to create a complex website without even downloading
    the files to your computer. How rad is that?

    ### Work together

    I am super thankful to anybody who tried out building a website with closeheat.
    All of us already learned huge lessons and will continue to stay sharp.
    Its our mission to help you build great experiences, work together and more
    importantly - having fun while doing it. Let's accept our differences and
    find a way to work together.
